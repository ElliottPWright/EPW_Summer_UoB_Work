Included here are the two programs you need to do any work related to the grazing angle investigation. First we have Allpix_Automation.py, which is the program I created to automate allpix taking data at 0 - 60 degrees in 5-degree increments. Then we have Plotting_Script.py, a program to allow you to plot clustering data, histograms, and depletion depths based on linear fits to the clustering data. Of course, both programs are well commented, so it should be clear how to use them.
