Included here are the speech and presentation slides I gave on 20/Aug/2024 (labelled simply presentation) and 21/Aug/2024 (labelled MALTA_MEETING). These were given to the BILPA group at the University of Birmingham and the MALTA2 CERN group respectively. I have not included the presentation speech for the MALTA presentation as it simply represents a shorting of the BILPA presentation, the cuts of which should be fairly self-explanatory. When reading through the speech, each section naturally maps onto a slide in the presentation.
