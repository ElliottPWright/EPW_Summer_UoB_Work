This data was taken with the aim of investigating the diffusion of electrons in the DUT sensor under different conditions. In RUN_1 and RUN_2, we take measurements for a single event without the telescope at V_bias = -30V, in RUN_3, with 10E4 events. 

In RUN_4, we overdeplete the sensor to V_bias = -50V to see if diffusion decreases further with 10E4. 

In RUN_5, data was taken at -30V and -50V with a 1T z-axis B-field. 

In RUN_6, the pixel pitch was 36.4um, 2ns integration time, -30V bias (fully depleted), scan of sensor thicknesses from 10 - 50 um.

In RUN_7, the pixel pitch was 36.4um, 2ns integration time, -30V bias (fully depleted), scan of pixel pitches from 10 - 50 um.
