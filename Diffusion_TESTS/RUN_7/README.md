For this run of data, the beam size was reduced to 10nm, the detector was first fully biased at -30V and the sensor thickness was 100um. This was then run for all angles with 10E4 event. For this the telescope was also removed to limit the spread of proton entry to DUT. The full 512 x 224 pixel matrix was used here too. Timing information is cut at 2ns for this run of data. A scan of pixel pitch was conducted from 10-50um was completed.
