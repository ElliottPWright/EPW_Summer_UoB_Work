For this run of data, the beam size was reduced to 10nm, the detector was first fully biased at -30V and the pixel pitch was 36.4um. This was then run for all angles with 10E4 event. For this the telescope was also removed to limit the spread of proton entry to DUT. The full 512 x 224 pixel matrix was used here too. Timing information is cut at 2ns for this run of data. A scan of sensor thicknesses from 10-50um was completed.
