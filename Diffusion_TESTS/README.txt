This data was taken with the aim of investigating the diffusion of electrons in the DUT sensor under different conditions. In RUN_1 and RUN_2, we take measurements for a single event without the telescope at V_bias = -30V, in RUN_3, with 10E4 events. In RUN_4, we overdeplete the sensor to V_bias = -50V to see if diffusion decreases further with 10E4. In RUN_5, data was taken at -30V and -50V with a 1T z-axis B-field.
