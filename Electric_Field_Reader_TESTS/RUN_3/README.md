This data was taken with the aim of investigating the form of the electric field. At this point, the telescope has been removed from the simulation. The depletion voltage of -30V is used, and the linear electric field equation solved to get the required sensor thickness. It might look confusing since all the data is labelling as being taken at V_bias = V_depletion, however, each time we are changing the depletion depth. For this run of data, the beam size was reduced to 10nm, the pixel pitch was 36.4um. This was then run for all angles with 10E4 event. For this the telescope was also removed to limit the spread of proton entry to DUT. A 3 x 3 pixel matrix was used in this investigation.
