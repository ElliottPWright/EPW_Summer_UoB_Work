This data was taken with the aim of investigating the form of the electric field. At this point, the telescope has been removed from the simulation. The depletion voltage of -30V is used, and the linear electric field equation solved to get the required sensor thickness. It might look confusing since all the data is labelling as being taken at V_bias = V_depletion, however, each time we are changing the depletion depth. Beam thickness = 1nm.
