This data was taken with the aim of investigating the form of the electric field. At this point, the telescope has been removed from the simulation. The depletion voltage of -30V is used, and the linear electric field equation solved to get the required sensor thickness. The full 512 x 224 pixel matrix is used here, plus the 36.4um pixel pitch.

It might look confusing since all the data is labelling as being taken at V_bias = V_depletion, however, each time we are changing the depletion depth.

Beam thickness = 10um
